# Frequently Asked Questions

## What are Lunatech's expectations?

We want to get an impression of how _you_ on a daily basis, to get an insight on
your design and development process (ie. the things that you think about when you
code)


## Do I need to implement _all_ three requirements?

No, you don't. Remember _Quality over Quantity_. We think is better to have
two requirements fully implemented instead of three half done.

Also consider that just like in your daily job, an implemented requirement doesnâ€™t
_just_ mean that the code works.

## Do I have to implement a Frontend?

No, it's not required. Only do it if you have time and think it will improve
the overall quality of the submission. Remember _Quality over Quantity_.

If this assessment is a fancy dinner, the backend should be considered the main
course and the frontend the dessert.


## Can I use language X or technology Y?

We recommend that you stick to Scala, Java, or Kotlin. While we could be review
almost any programming language, Lunatech works on projects using these two
languages and we want to see how do you work them.

Regarding technologies, such as libraries and frameworks, use whatever you think
it's best. You don't like PostgreSQL? Throw it out the window and put a DB you like
working with.


## Can I change something from the initial setup?

Yes, you can. Remember, this is _your_ assessment. Perform any changes that you think
are necessary. As long as the requirements are fulfilled, you're free to change whatever
you want.


## Does performance matter?

It depends. If you know your implementation has performance concerns, be prepared to discuss
them. Otherwise taking extra time to improve it won't add much.


## What should I do after create the Pull Request?

When you create the pull request, two Lunatech colleagues will be automatically assigned
as reviewers. Please **don't** close the PR, the reviewers will do it after inspecting
the code.


## Can I get an extension on the submission date?

Yes, of course you can. Just sent us an email so we can know you want more time
before sending us the solution.


## I still have questions that aren't covered in this FAQ, what should I do?

Part of the assessment is being able to examine your assumptions and development process.
Try to think about what a potential user would like to see for each one for the requirements.

If you are still unsure, don't hesitate to send us an email so we can clarify any pending questions.
